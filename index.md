# About

I am currently a Software Engineer @ Youtube where I work on ML applications and infrastructure for better music understanding. Most recently our team helped launch [personalized mood experiences](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/youtube-music-brings-personalization-your-everyday-moods-and-moments/) in YouTube Music. See our recent [paper](https://program.ismir2020.net/static/final_papers/125.pdf) for more details.

Before that I  was a grad student at the Purdue University, Indiana, pursuing my Masters (thesis) in Computer Science and was part of DCSL Lab advised by Prof. Saurabh Bagchi. 
I completed my bachelor's degree (B. Tech. in CSE) from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.

I also worked briefly at Samsung R&D Institute, India as part of a focused research group working on future technology for smart devices. A fun project we worked on was Tennis game analysis using wearable sensors data.
